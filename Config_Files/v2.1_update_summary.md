# Claude Code Dev Stack v2.1 Update Summary

## Update Overview
All 28 agent configuration files have been successfully updated to support @agent- deterministic routing and model selection.

## Changes Made
1. Added `@agent-mention Routing` section to all 28 agent files
2. Implemented deterministic invocation syntax: `@agent-[name]`
3. Added model override options: `@agent-[name][opus]` and `@agent-[name][haiku]`
4. Assigned recommended models based on agent complexity and requirements

## Model Distribution
- **Opus Model (11 agents)**: High-complexity agents requiring advanced reasoning
  - business-analyst
  - backend-services (solution-architect)
  - ceo-strategy (strategic-advisor)
  - database-architect
  - frontend-architect (solution-architect)
  - master-orchestrator (ai-architect)
  - performance (performance-specialist)
  - project-manager (project-init)
  - security-architect
  - tech-cto (tech-feasibility)
  - tech-specs (system-architect)

- **Haiku Model (4 agents)**: Code review and documentation agents
  - devops (scrum-master)
  - qa (code-reviewer, qa-lead)
  - tech-docs (documentation, technical-writer)
  - testing (testing-engineer)

- **Default Model (13 agents)**: Standard complexity agents
  - api-integration
  - business-tech
  - dev-prompt
  - financial-analyst
  - frontend-mockup
  - integration-setup
  - middleware
  - mobile-dev
  - prod-frontend
  - prompt-engineer
  - script-automation
  - ui-ux
  - usage-guide

## Routing Syntax Examples
```
# Standard invocation (uses recommended model)
@agent-business-analyst analyze market opportunity

# Force Opus model
@agent-qa[opus] perform deep code analysis

# Force Haiku model
@agent-backend-services[haiku] create simple API endpoint
```

## Benefits
1. **Deterministic Routing**: Predictable agent selection without ambiguity
2. **Model Flexibility**: Override default models when needed
3. **Cost Optimization**: Appropriate models for each task complexity
4. **Performance**: Faster responses for simpler tasks using Haiku
5. **Quality**: Complex tasks leverage Opus capabilities

## Verification
- Total files updated: 28/28
- All files contain @agent-mention routing section
- Model recommendations align with complexity requirements
- Backwards compatibility maintained with existing @mentions
