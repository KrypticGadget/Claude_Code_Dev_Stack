## How to Use These Templates

### Method 1: Direct Agent Usage

#### 1. Choose Your Template
Browse the directories to find the template that matches your need.

#### 2. Copy the Prompt
Copy the relevant prompt from the template file.

#### 3. Replace Variables
Replace all `[BRACKETED VARIABLES]` with your specific values:
- `[APPLICATION TYPE]` ‚Üí "task management"
- `[USER COUNT]` ‚Üí "10,000"
- `[TECHNOLOGY]` ‚Üí "React Native"

#### 4. Use in Claude Code
Paste the customized prompt into Claude Code:
```
> [Your customized prompt here]
```

### Method 2: Using Slash Commands (Recommended)

Many common operations have pre-built slash commands that are faster:

```bash
# Instead of copying and customizing a template:
/new-project "task management app for 10,000 users using React Native"

# Other quick commands:
/frontend-mockup "dashboard for analytics"
/backend-service "REST API with authentication"
/database-design "multi-tenant schema"
```

Install slash commands for instant access:
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/claude-code-agent-system/main/slash-commands/install-commands.sh | bash
```

## Quick Start Examples

### Starting a New SaaS Project

**Using Agent:**
```
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "Multi-tenant SaaS platform for project management with subscription billing, team collaboration, admin dashboard, and API access. Target market is small businesses with freemium pricing model."
```

**Using Slash Command:**
```
/new-project "Multi-tenant SaaS platform for project management with subscription billing"
```

### Adding Authentication

**Using Agent:**
```
> Use the security-architecture agent to implement JWT authentication for my application with refresh tokens and secure storage
```

**Using Slash Command:**
```
/api-integration "JWT auth" requirements:"refresh tokens, secure storage"
```

### Fixing Performance Issues

**Using Agent:**
```
> Use the performance-optimization agent to analyze slow API endpoint /api/products currently taking 2 seconds and optimize to under 200ms
```

**Note:** Performance optimization doesn't have a dedicated slash command yet - use the agent directly.

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
The more specific your prompt, the better the results:
- ‚ùå "Build an e-commerce site"
- ‚úÖ "E-commerce platform for handmade crafts with multi-vendor support, Etsy integration, and $50 average order value"

### 2. Include Constraints
Mention important constraints upfront:
- Timeline: "to be developed in 3 months"
- Budget: "with a $50K budget"
- Team: "by 2 developers"
- Compliance: "HIPAA compliant"

### 3. Specify Integrations
List any required third-party services:
- Payment: "integrated with Stripe and PayPal"
- Email: "using SendGrid for transactional emails"
- Analytics: "with Google Analytics and Mixpanel"

### 4. Define Success Metrics
Include performance requirements:
- Scale: "supporting 100K daily active users"
- Speed: "with sub-second page loads"
- Uptime: "99.9% availability SLA"
