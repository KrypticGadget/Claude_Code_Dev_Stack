# Test /orchestrate-demo Command

## Quick Test:
```
/orchestrate-demo user authentication, real-time chat, payment processing, mobile apps
```

## Expected Behavior:

### 1. Slash Command Detection ✓
- `slash_command_router.py` detects `/orchestrate-demo`
- Routes to special orchestration handler
- Triggers ALL 27 agents in proper hierarchy

### 2. Audio Feedback Sequence ✓
- Each agent invocation should trigger specific audio
- Listen for sequential sounds:
  - prompt_engineering.wav (Phase 1)
  - master_orchestrator.wav (Phase 2) 
  - business_analysis.wav (Phase 3)
  - technical_planning.wav (Phase 4)
  - frontend_development.wav (Phase 5)
  - backend_development.wav (Phase 6)
  - mobile_development.wav (Phase 7)
  - quality_assurance.wav (Phase 8)
  - deployment_operations.wav (Phase 9)
  - automation_complete.wav (Phase 10)

### 3. Agent Execution Order ✓
1. **Prompt Engineer** → Enhanced requirements
2. **Master Orchestrator** → Coordinates all phases
3. **Business Group** → Strategy, analysis, alignment  
4. **Technical Leadership** → Architecture, specs, security
5. **Frontend Group** → UI/UX, mockups, production
6. **Backend Group** → APIs, database, middleware
7. **Mobile & Quality** → Apps, testing, QA
8. **Operations** → DevOps, scripts, docs
9. **Automation** → Workflows, guides

### 4. Expected Output ✓
Each agent should produce specific deliverables showing their expertise:
- Business cases and financial models
- Technical specifications and architecture
- Code implementations and prototypes  
- Test suites and deployment scripts
- Documentation and guides

## Test Command:
```
/orchestrate-demo e-commerce platform with user auth, real-time notifications, payment integration, admin dashboard, mobile apps, and full deployment pipeline
```

This will trigger the complete orchestration with audio feedback!
