- ✅ Resumes context on `/resume-project`
- ✅ Maintains state across sessions
- ✅ Tracks file changes

**Manual Override (if needed)**
```prompt
/session save "Checkpoint before major refactor"
/session load "last-working-state"
```

### Quality Gates (Automatic)

Every code generation passes through:
1. **Syntax validation** - No broken code
2. **Best practices check** - Industry standards
3. **Security scan** - No vulnerabilities
4. **Performance analysis** - No obvious bottlenecks

### Planning Triggers (Automatic)

Complex tasks automatically trigger planning:
- Tasks mentioning "architecture" → System design
- Tasks mentioning "scale" → Performance planning
- Tasks mentioning "security" → Security review
