# B2B2C Development Guide

This guide demonstrates how to leverage the Claude Code Agent System for building Business-to-Business-to-Consumer (B2B2C) applications.

## What is B2B2C?

B2B2C platforms serve two distinct user groups:
- **Business Users (B2B)**: Companies that use your platform to serve their customers
- **End Consumers (B2C)**: The final users who interact with businesses through your platform

Examples: Shopify (merchants → shoppers), Uber for Business (companies → employees), WhiteLabel SaaS platforms

## B2B2C Architecture Patterns

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture

```
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "B2B2C platform with multi-tenant architecture supporting isolated business accounts, white-label customization, and shared infrastructure for cost efficiency"
```

The system will coordinate:
- **@agent-database-architecture Agent**: Design tenant isolation strategy
- **@agent-security-architecture Agent**: Implement data security boundaries
- **@agent-backend-services Agent**: Create tenant-aware APIs

### 2. Platform Components

A typical B2B2C platform requires:

#### Business Portal (B2B)
- Admin dashboard
- Analytics and reporting
- Customer management
- Billing and subscriptions
- API access

#### Consumer Interface (B2C)
- Public-facing website/app
- User authentication
- Transaction processing
- Support system

#### Platform Administration
- Super admin controls
- Tenant management
- Platform analytics
- Revenue sharing

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Business Analysis

```
> Use the business-analyst agent to analyze B2B2C market opportunity for [YOUR DOMAIN] including TAM, pricing models, and competitive landscape
```

Key considerations:
- Business customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Consumer lifetime value (LTV)
- Platform fee structure
- Network effects potential

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture

```
> Use the technical-cto agent to design B2B2C architecture with tenant isolation, scalability for [BUSINESS COUNT] businesses and [CONSUMER COUNT] consumers
```

Architecture decisions:
- **Data Isolation**: Shared database with row-level security vs. database per tenant
- **Customization**: White-label capabilities, custom domains
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling per tenant
- **Integration**: API strategy for business customers

### Phase 3: Database Design

```
> Use the database-architecture agent to design multi-tenant schema for B2B2C platform with proper isolation, performance, and scalability
```

Schema considerations:
```sql
-- Core tables with tenant isolation
CREATE TABLE tenants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  subdomain VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  custom_domain VARCHAR(255),
  settings JSONB,
  subscription_tier VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  role VARCHAR(50), -- 'business_admin', 'business_user', 'consumer'
  UNIQUE(tenant_id, email)
);

-- Row-level security
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON users
  FOR ALL USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid);
```

### Phase 4: API Development

```
> Use the backend-services agent to implement B2B2C API with tenant-aware endpoints, rate limiting per tenant, and usage tracking
```

API structure:
- `/api/v1/business/*` - Business management endpoints
- `/api/v1/consumer/*` - Consumer-facing endpoints
- `/api/v1/platform/*` - Platform admin endpoints
- `/api/v1/public/*` - Public tenant APIs

### Phase 5: Frontend Development

#### Business Dashboard
```
> Use the frontend-architecture agent to design B2B business dashboard with analytics, customer management, and configuration options
```

#### Consumer Application
```
> Use the production-frontend agent to build consumer-facing application with tenant-specific branding and features
```

### Phase 6: Mobile Strategy

```
> Use the mobile-development agent to create B2B2C mobile strategy supporting both business management app and consumer app
```

Options:
- Single app with role-based UI
- Separate business and consumer apps
- White-label app framework

## Common B2B2C Features

### 1. Subscription & Billing

```
> Use the api-integration-specialist agent to implement tiered subscription billing for business customers with usage-based pricing
```

Features:
- Multiple pricing tiers
- Usage metering
- Revenue sharing
- Invoice generation

### 2. White-Label Capabilities

```
> Use the frontend-architecture agent to implement white-label system allowing businesses to customize branding, colors, and domains
```

Customizations:
- Custom domains
- Brand colors and logos
- Email templates
- Feature toggles

### 3. Analytics & Reporting

```
> Use the backend-services agent to build analytics system providing insights for both business customers and platform administrators
```

Analytics layers:
- Platform-level metrics
- Business-level dashboards
- Consumer behavior tracking
- Revenue analytics

### 4. API & Integrations

```
> Use the api-integration-specialist agent to create comprehensive API for business customers with SDKs, webhooks, and documentation
```

API features:
- RESTful and GraphQL options
- Webhook events
- Rate limiting per tenant
- API key management

## Security Considerations

### Tenant Isolation

```
> Use the security-architecture agent to implement comprehensive tenant isolation ensuring data security between business accounts
```

Security measures:
- Row-level security in database
- API-level tenant validation
- Separate encryption keys per tenant
- Audit logging per tenant

### Compliance

```
> Use the security-architecture agent to implement compliance features for [REGULATIONS] with tenant-specific requirements
```

Common requirements:
- GDPR for consumer data
- PCI DSS for payments
- SOC 2 for enterprise customers
- Industry-specific regulations

## Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling

```
> Use the devops-engineering agent to implement horizontal scaling strategy for B2B2C platform with per-tenant resource allocation
```

Scaling patterns:
- Shared infrastructure with limits
- Dedicated resources for premium tiers
- Geographic distribution
- Caching per tenant

### Performance Optimization

```
> Use the performance-optimization agent to optimize B2B2C platform for [METRIC] ensuring consistent performance across all tenants
```

Optimization areas:
- Query optimization with tenant filtering
- Caching strategies per tenant
- CDN for white-label domains
- Background job prioritization

## Example B2B2C Implementations

### E-commerce Platform
```
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "B2B2C e-commerce platform where businesses can create online stores and sell to consumers, similar to Shopify"
```

### SaaS Management Platform
```
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "B2B2C SaaS platform allowing companies to manage software subscriptions for their employees"
```

### Service Marketplace
```
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "B2B2C service marketplace connecting service providers with consumers through business partnerships"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Core Platform Features**: Build the foundation before tenant-specific features
2. **Design for Isolation Early**: Retrofitting tenant isolation is difficult
3. **Plan for Customization**: Business customers will want differentiation
4. **Monitor Per-Tenant Metrics**: Track usage, performance, and costs per tenant
5. **Automate Onboarding**: Make it easy for new businesses to join
6. **Provide Excellent APIs**: Your business customers are developers too
7. **Scale Gradually**: Start with shared infrastructure, move to dedicated as needed

## Next Steps

1. Define your specific B2B2C model and requirements
2. Use the master orchestrator to begin your project
3. Focus on MVP for both business and consumer sides
4. Iterate based on feedback from both user groups

Remember: B2B2C success depends on creating value for both businesses and consumers. The platform must be robust enough for business needs while remaining simple for consumer use.
