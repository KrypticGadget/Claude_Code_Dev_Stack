## Security Considerations

### Access Control Implementation
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement role-based permissions
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
3. **Audit Logging**: Track all access and modifications
4. **Regular Review**: Periodic permission audits

### File System Permissions
```bash
# Tier 0: Restricted access
chmod 750 tier0/

# Tier 1: Leadership access
chmod 755 tier1/

# Tier 2: Specialist access
chmod 755 tier2/

# Tier 3: Implementation access
chmod 755 tier3/

# Shared: General access
chmod 755 shared/ templates/ utilities/

# Hooks: Controlled access
chmod 750 hooks/

# Services: Controlled access
chmod 750 docker-services/
```

### Environment-Specific Permissions

#### Development Environment
- More permissive for experimentation
- All agents can read most directories
- Write access limited by domain

#### Staging Environment
- Moderate restrictions
- Testing and validation focus
- Limited write access

#### Production Environment
- Strict access controls
- Audit all changes
- Minimal write permissions
- Emergency access procedures

## Compliance Notes

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data only in appropriate tiers
- Encryption for data at rest
- Secure transmission protocols

### Change Management
- All structural changes require approval
- Version control for permission changes
- Rollback procedures documented

### Monitoring
- Real-time access monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Regular security assessments

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Tasks
1. Weekly permission audits
2. Monthly access reviews
3. Quarterly security assessments
4. Annual comprehensive reviews

### Emergency Procedures
1. Immediate revocation protocols
2. Incident response procedures
3. Recovery and restoration
4. Post-incident analysis
