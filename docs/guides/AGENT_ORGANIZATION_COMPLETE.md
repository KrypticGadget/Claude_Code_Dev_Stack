- Proper tier assignment according to registry schema
- Consistent team assignments and specializations
- Correct priority ordering within tiers

### Delegation Hierarchies ✅
- **Tier 0**: prompt-engineer coordinates master-orchestrator
- **Tier 1**: Strategic agents report to appropriate Tier 0 agents
- **Tier 2**: Domain specialists report to strategic orchestrators
- **Tier 3**: Implementation specialists report to domain experts

### Communication Paths ✅
- Clear escalation paths from Tier 3 → Tier 2 → Tier 1 → Tier 0
- Proper coordination paths between related specialists
- BMAD workflow integration with core system established
- Cross-functional collaboration patterns defined

### BMAD Workflow Integration ✅
- **Phase 1**: Business Model (bmad-business-model → bmad-market-research)
- **Phase 2**: Architecture Design (bmad-architecture-design → bmad-technical-planning) 
- **Phase 3**: Design (bmad-design → bmad-user-experience + bmad-visual-design)
- **Phase 4**: Validation (bmad-validation validates all phases)
- **Phase 5**: Integration (bmad-integration → core system handoff)

## No Conflicts or Missing Dependencies ✅
- All 37 agents from registry successfully placed
- No circular dependencies in hierarchy
- All delegation relationships properly established
