# Your First Project with Claude Code Dev Stack

This guide walks you through creating your first complete project using all 4 components of the stack.

## 🎯 What We'll Build

A simple task management API with:
- User authentication
- Database persistence
- REST endpoints
- Automated tests
- Documentation

## 📋 Step 1: Initialize the Project

```bash
/new-project "Task management API with user authentication"
```

Watch as the system automatically engages:
- `@agent-system-architect` - Designs the architecture
- `@agent-database-architect` - Creates the data model
- `@agent-backend-engineer` - Implements the API
- `@agent-security-architect` - Adds authentication

## 🏗️ Step 2: Understand What's Happening

### Agents Working Together
```
System Architect: "I'll design a RESTful API with JWT authentication"
Database Architect: "Creating tables for users, tasks, and sessions"
Backend Engineer: "Implementing Express.js with TypeScript"
Security Architect: "Adding bcrypt for passwords and JWT for tokens"
```

### MCPs Activating
- **Brave Search** activates to research best practices
- **Obsidian** stores architectural decisions
- **Playwright** will activate for testing

### Hooks Running
- `session_saver.py` preserves your progress
- `agent_orchestrator.py` coordinates responses
- `quality_gate.py` ensures code standards

## 💻 Step 3: Enhance with Commands

Add more features using slash commands:

```bash
# Add data validation
/backend-service "Input validation middleware"

# Create API documentation
/documentation "REST API endpoints"

# Add integration tests
/test-suite "API integration tests"
```

## 🚀 Step 4: Deploy

```bash
/deployment-setup "Docker containerization" @agent-devops-engineer
```

## 📊 What You've Learned

1. **Slash Commands** start workflows
2. **Agents** collaborate automatically
3. **MCPs** provide external capabilities
4. **Hooks** handle automation silently

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You've just built a complete API using the 4-stack system. Key takeaways:

- No need to specify models (hooks optimize)
- Agents know when to collaborate
- MCPs activate contextually
- Your session is saved automatically

## 📚 Next Steps

- Try: `/frontend-mockup "Task management UI"`
- Read: [Best Practices](../guides/BEST_PRACTICES.md)
- Explore: [Agent Teams](../reference/AGENT_REFERENCE.md#power-combinations)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be specific** in your initial request
2. **Trust the automation** - don't micromanage
3. **Use agent teams** for better results
4. **Let hooks handle** model selection
