## ⚡ 30-Second Quick Start

### The Absolute Fastest Way to Start

```prompt
/new-project "My Awesome App"
@agent-master-orchestrator @agent-business-analyst
Tell me what you want to build, and I'll handle the rest!
```

That's it! The agents will:
- Ask clarifying questions
- Plan your architecture
- Start building immediately
- Guide you through each step

### Three Quick Examples That Just Work

**Example 1: Build a SaaS MVP**
```prompt
/new-project "Task Management SaaS"
@agent-master-orchestrator @agent-business-analyst
Industry: B2B Software
Users: Small teams (5-20 people)
Core features: Tasks, projects, team collaboration
Tech preference: React + Node.js
```

**Example 2: Add Stripe Payments**
```prompt
/resume-project
@agent-api-integration-specialist integrate Stripe payments
@agent-backend-services create subscription management
Requirements: Monthly/yearly plans, team billing
```

**Example 3: Fix Performance**
```prompt
Issue: API responses taking >2 seconds
@agent-backend-services investigate slow queries

## 🏗️ AIMS Framework Explained

Think of AIMS as your **prompt construction blueprint** - follow it for perfect results every time!

### The AIMS Recipe

```
A - Agent Selection    → WHO will do the work (the chef)
I - Integration       → WHAT tools they need (the kitchen tools)
M - Method           → HOW they'll do it (the recipe steps)
S - Structure        → WHY in this order (the cooking sequence)
```

### 🅰️ **A - Agent Selection** (WHO)

Think of agents as **specialized experts** you'd hire for a project:

- **Need business strategy?** → `@agent-business-analyst`
- **Need to build an API?** → `@agent-backend-services`
- **Need to fix bugs?** → `@agent-testing-automation`
- **Need architecture?** → `@agent-database-architecture`

**The Golden Rule**: Always use `@agent-` prefix, never add model names!

```prompt
✅ CORRECT: @agent-backend-services
❌ WRONG:   @agent-backend-services[opus]
❌ WRONG:   @backend-services
```

### 🔗 **I - Integration** (WHAT)

Your agents have access to powerful tools:

| Tool Type | What It Does | Example Use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **MCP Tools** | Extend capabilities | Browser testing, web search |
| **Hooks** | Automate workflows | Session management (automatic!) |
| **PDFs** | Provide context | "Read requirements.pdf" |
| **External APIs** | Connect services | Stripe, SendGrid, AWS |

> 💡 **Quick Win**: PDFs are the fastest way to give agents context!

### 🎯 **M - Method** (HOW)

Commands set the stage for your agents:

- **Starting fresh?** → `/new-project`
- **Continuing work?** → `/resume-project`
- **Need analysis?** → `/business-analysis`
- **Building features?** → `/backend-service`
- **Planning architecture?** → `/technical-feasibility`

**Pro Pattern**: Command + Agents + Details = Success

### 📋 **S - Structure** (WHY)

The right structure ensures clarity and completeness:

```prompt
1. Set context with a command
2. Call the right agents
3. Provide specific requirements
4. Reference resources (PDFs)
5. State constraints (budget, time)
6. Define success criteria
```

**Perfect AIMS Example**:
```prompt
/new-project "E-commerce Platform"              # Method (command)
@agent-master-orchestrator @agent-business-analyst  # Agents (who)
Requirements: Multi-vendor, 100k users          # Structure (details)
Read: "market-analysis.pdf"                     # Integration (resources)
Timeline: 8 weeks, cost-conscious               # Structure (constraints)
Success: MVP with payments working              # Structure (criteria)
```
