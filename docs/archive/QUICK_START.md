# Quick Start Guide - Claude Code Agent System

Welcome to the Claude Code Agent System! Get up and running in just 2 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed ([Installation Guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code))
- Git (for installation)
- Mac, Linux, or Windows with WSL

## 2-Minute Setup

### 1. Install the Agent System (30 seconds)

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/claude-code-agent-system/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or clone and install manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-code-agent-system.git
cd claude-code-agent-system
./install.sh
```

### 2. Verify Installation (10 seconds)

```bash
ls ~/.claude/agents/
```

You should see 28 specialized agent files.

### 3. Start Your First Project (80 seconds)

Launch Claude Code and use the Master Orchestrator:

```bash
claude

> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "Simple task management web app with user authentication"
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Analyze project viability
2. Plan technical architecture
3. Coordinate all specialized agents
4. Guide you through decision points

## Your First Commands

### Use the Master Orchestrator
```bash
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "Your project description"
```

### Use Individual Agents
```bash
# Business analysis
> Use the business-analyst agent to evaluate ROI for my SaaS idea

# Technical planning
> Use the technical-cto agent to assess technical feasibility

# Frontend development
> Use the frontend-mockup agent to create UI prototypes

# Backend development
> Use the backend-services agent to design API architecture
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Full Stack Web Application
```bash
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "E-commerce platform with inventory management"
```

### 2. Mobile App Development
```bash
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "Cross-platform mobile app for fitness tracking"
```

### 3. API Service
```bash
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "RESTful API for payment processing"
```

### 4. Quick Frontend Prototype
```bash
> Use the frontend-mockup agent to create a landing page prototype for my startup
```

## Understanding the Workflow

### Phase 1: Business Strategy
The system starts with business analysis:
- ROI calculations
- Market opportunity assessment
- Technical feasibility
- Financial projections

### Phase 2: Technical Planning
Then moves to technical architecture:
- Technology stack selection
- Timeline creation
- Resource planning
- Requirements documentation

### Phase 3: Implementation
Finally, coordinated development:
- Frontend and backend development
- Database design
- API integrations
- Testing and deployment

## Quick Tips

### 1. Let the Orchestrator Guide You
The Master Orchestrator manages the entire workflow. Start there for new projects.

### 2. Decision Points
The system will pause at key decision points for your input:
- Business approval
- Technical architecture review
- Development milestones

### 3. Parallel Processing
Multiple agents can work simultaneously:
```bash
# The orchestrator automatically manages parallel tasks
Frontend Architecture → Frontend Mockup → Production Frontend
Backend Services → Database Architecture → API Integration
```

### 4. Use Specific Agents for Quick Tasks
```bash
# Quick database schema review
> Use the database-architecture agent to optimize my user table schema

# API integration help
> Use the api-integration-specialist agent to integrate Stripe payments

# Security audit
> Use the security-architecture agent to review my authentication flow
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agents Not Found
```bash
# Reinstall agents
./install.sh

# Or manually copy
cp Config_Files/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Command Not Working
Make sure to use exact syntax:
```bash
# Correct
> Use the [agent-name] agent to [task]

# Incorrect
> use agent-name for task
```

### Missing Dependencies
Some agents may require specific tools:
```bash
# Install common dependencies
npm install -g npm yarn
pip install --user pipenv
```
