# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Claude Code Dev Stack v3.0 - Comprehensive CI/CD System

This repository includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline designed specifically for the Claude Code Development Stack v3.0. The pipeline provides automated testing, security scanning, deployment, and release management.

### üöÄ Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD system consists of several interconnected workflows that ensure code quality, security, and reliable deployments:

1. **Attribution Check** - Validates licensing and contributor attribution
2. **Size Validation** - Monitors bundle sizes and performance budgets  
3. **Comprehensive Testing** - Multi-platform testing across Python and Node.js
4. **Security Scanning** - Vulnerability and secret detection
5. **Build & Deploy** - Automated building and deployment
6. **Release Automation** - Automated versioning and changelog generation

### üìã Workflow Files

| Workflow | File | Purpose | Trigger |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| Main Pipeline | `main-pipeline.yml` | Orchestrates all other workflows | Push to main/develop, PRs |
| Attribution Check | `attribution-check.yml` | License and attribution validation | Push, PRs, weekly schedule |
| Size Validation | `size-validation.yml` | Bundle size and performance monitoring | Push, PRs |
| Testing Suite | `testing.yml` | Comprehensive testing across platforms | Push, PRs, daily schedule |
| Security Scan | `security-scan.yml` | Security vulnerability scanning | Push, PRs, weekly schedule |
| Build & Deploy | `build-deploy.yml` | Build artifacts and deploy to environments | Push to main, tags |

### üîß Configuration

#### Environment Variables

The pipeline uses several environment variables that can be configured:

```yaml
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '18'                    # Node.js version for builds
  PYTHON_VERSION: '3.11'               # Python version for testing
  MAX_BUNDLE_SIZE_KB: 2048             # Bundle size limit in KB
  COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: 80               # Code coverage requirement
  SECURITY_SCAN_LEVEL: 'comprehensive' # Security scan depth
```

#### Secrets Required

To fully utilize all pipeline features, configure these GitHub secrets:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - For Python package publishing (optional)
- `FOSSA_API_KEY` - For advanced license scanning (optional)

### üéØ Usage

#### Automatic Triggers

The pipeline automatically runs on:

- **Push to main/develop**: Full pipeline execution
- **Pull Requests**: Validation and testing only
- **Tags (v*)**: Production deployment and release
- **Scheduled**: Security scans and dependency updates

#### Manual Triggers

You can manually trigger workflows with custom parameters:

1. **Main Pipeline**: 
   - Skip tests or security scans
   - Force deployment

2. **Release Automation**:
   - Choose release type (patch/minor/major/prerelease)
   - Create draft or pre-releases

3. **Security Scanning**:
   - Adjust scan level (basic/comprehensive/advanced)

#### Workflow Dispatch Examples

```bash
# Trigger main pipeline with custom settings
gh workflow run main-pipeline.yml \
  -f skip_tests=false \
  -f skip_security=false \
  -f force_deploy=true

# Create a new release
gh workflow run release-automation.yml \
  -f release_type=minor \
  -f pre_release=false \
  -f draft_release=false

# Run comprehensive security scan
gh workflow run security-scan.yml \
  -f scan_level=advanced
```

### üìä Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Attribution & License Validation

- **Purpose**: Ensure proper attribution and license compliance
- **Checks**: 
  - Dependency license compatibility
  - Source file attribution
  - Repository metadata validation
- **Artifacts**: Attribution reports, license summaries

#### 2. Size & Performance Validation

- **Purpose**: Monitor bundle sizes and performance impact
- **Checks**:
  - Bundle size limits
  - Individual file size limits
  - Performance budget validation
- **Artifacts**: Size analysis reports, bundle manifests

#### 3. Comprehensive Testing

- **Purpose**: Validate functionality across platforms
- **Test Types**:
  - Unit tests (Python & Node.js)
  - Integration tests
  - End-to-end tests
  - Cross-browser testing (optional)
- **Platforms**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS

### üìö Best Practices

#### Development Workflow

1. **Feature Branches**: Create feature branches for new work
2. **Pull Requests**: Always use PRs for code review
3. **Testing**: Ensure tests pass before merging
4. **Security**: Address security findings promptly

#### Release Management

1. **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semver principles
2. **Release Notes**: Maintain clear, descriptive changelogs
3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test releases before production
4. **Rollback Plans**: Have rollback procedures ready
