# ðŸš€ Ultimate Claude Code Tech Stack - Action Plan

## Your 30-Minute Setup Process

### Step 1: Create Base Directory (2 min)
```powershell
# In PowerShell
mkdir claude-code-dev-stack-v21
cd claude-code-dev-stack-v21
```

### Step 2: Download All Artifacts (5 min)
1. Go through our conversation
2. Download each artifact listed in the **Artifact Download Reference Table**
3. Save each to its specified folder per the table

### Step 3: Extract Code from Guides (10 min)
Open `HOOKS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` and extract:
- All `.py` files â†’ Save to `hook-templates/`
- All `.json` configs â†’ Save to `config-templates/`

### Step 4: Create Quick Start Files (3 min)
Create these two files in `quick-start/`:

**IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md** (copy from File Structure Guide)
**CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md** with this content:

```markdown
# Master Implementation Prompt

I have the complete Claude Code Dev Stack v2.1 package in this directory.

Please implement everything by:
1. Reading `implementation-prompts/INTEGRATED_DEV_PROMPT.md`
2. Following `quick-start/IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md`
3. Using guides from `implementation-guides/`

Start with Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure
@ai-architect[opus] @devops-automation @backend-engineer
```

### Step 5: Launch Claude Code (10 min)
1. Open Claude Code in the `claude-code-dev-stack-v21` directory
2. Paste this prompt:

```
I need to implement the Claude Code Dev Stack v2.1. 
Please read `quick-start/CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md` and begin implementation.
@ai-architect[opus] @project-init[opus]

All implementation files are in this directory. Start by analyzing the structure,
then follow the implementation order systematically.
```

3. Claude Code will:
   - Read all your files
   - Understand the complete plan
   - Implement everything phase by phase
   - Use @-mentions for deterministic routing
   - Optimize costs with model selection
   - Set up hooks, MCPs, and meta-prompting

## ðŸ”¥ One-Line Summary

**Download artifacts â†’ Organize in folders â†’ Open Claude Code â†’ Paste master prompt â†’ Watch it build everything**

---

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Success Tips

1. **Let Claude Code Read Everything**: It will understand the full scope better than explaining
2. **Trust the @-mentions**: They guarantee the right agents work on right tasks
3. **Monitor Costs**: Check `model_usage.json` to see your savings
4. **Use PDFs**: Drop any existing docs in the folder for agents to reference
5. **Embrace Microcompact**: Work all day without manual context management

---

## ðŸŽŠ Final Result

You'll have the most advanced Claude Code development environment possible:
- **Deterministic** agent control
- **Cost-optimized** operations (40-60% savings)
- **Marathon** coding sessions
- **Intelligent** automation
- **Production-ready** infrastructure

**Your "Ultimate Claude Code Tech Stack Setup" will be complete! ðŸš€**
