# üöÄ Claude Code Stack Master Prompting Guide

## Overview
This guide enables any Claude instance to generate perfectly integrated prompts for the Claude Code Agent System, incorporating 28 specialized agents, 18 slash commands, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.

## üéØ Meta-Prompting Methodology

### Core Principle
Every prompt should follow the **AIMS** structure:
- **A**gent: Select the right agent(s) for the task
- **I**ntegration: Include relevant MCP tools
- **M**ethod: Choose appropriate slash commands
- **S**tructure: Format for optimal Claude Code execution

### Prompt Generation Formula
```
[Slash Command] + [Context] + [Constraints] + [MCP Tools] + [Agent Routing]
```

## üìã Quick Reference Tables

### Slash Commands by Purpose
| Purpose | Command | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Start Project** | `/new-project` | Complete project initialization with all analysis |
| **Resume Work** | `/resume-project` | Continue existing projects |
| **Frontend** | `/frontend-mockup` | UI prototypes and components |
| **Backend** | `/backend-service` | API design and services |
| **Database** | `/database-design` | Schema and data modeling |
| **Infrastructure** | `/cloud-setup` | AWS, Azure, GCP configuration |
| **Testing** | `/test-suite` | Comprehensive test generation |
| **Documentation** | `/documentation` | Technical docs and guides |
| **Security** | `/security-audit` | Vulnerability assessment |
| **Optimization** | `/optimize` | Performance improvements |

### Agent Specializations
| Category | Agents | Primary Use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Orchestration** | AI Architect, Project Init | High-level coordination |
| **Business** | Business Analyst, Strategic Advisor | ROI, market analysis |
| **Architecture** | System/Solution Architect | Technical design |
| **Development** | Backend/Frontend Engineer | Implementation |
| **Quality** | QA Lead, Testing Engineer | Testing & validation |
| **DevOps** | DevOps Specialist, Cloud Specialist | Deployment & scaling |
| **Security** | Security Architect | Compliance & protection |

### MCP Tool Categories (Tier 1 Priority)
| Tool Type | Integration | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **File System** | `@file-system` | Read/write project files |
| **Git** | `@git` | Version control operations |
| **Database** | `@database` | Direct DB queries |
| **API Testing** | `@api-test` | Endpoint validation |
| **Environment** | `@env-config` | Variable management |

## üî• Master Prompt Templates

MCP Tools: @file-system for structure, @git for initialization, @env-config for setup
Routing: Start with Strategic Advisor ‚Üí Business Analyst ‚Üí System Architect ‚Üí [Specialized Agents]
```

### 2. Feature Development
```
/backend-service "[FEATURE_DESCRIPTION]"
Context: Existing project at [PROJECT_PATH]
Requirements: [FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS]
Constraints: [PERFORMANCE_NEEDS], [SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS]
MCP Tools: @file-system for code generation, @database for schema updates, @api-test for validation
Routing: Backend Engineer ‚Üí Database Architect ‚Üí API Gateway Specialist ‚Üí Testing Engineer
```

### 3. Infrastructure & Deployment
```
/cloud-setup "[INFRASTRUCTURE_NEEDS]"
Environment: [DEV/STAGING/PROD]
Scale: [EXPECTED_LOAD]
Services: [REQUIRED_SERVICES]
MCP Tools: @env-config for secrets, @git for IaC, @file-system for configs
Routing: Cloud Infrastructure Specialist ‚Üí DevOps Automation ‚Üí Security Architect
```

## üé® Prompt Engineering Patterns

### Pattern 1: Progressive Enhancement
```
Step 1: /technical-feasibility "[IDEA]" constraints:[TECHNICAL_LIMITS]
Step 2: /project-plan based on feasibility results
Step 3: /new-project with refined scope
Step 4: Iterate with specific agents
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Development
```
Concurrent Execution:
- /frontend-mockup "[UI_REQUIREMENTS]" ‚Üí Frontend Architect
- /backend-service "[API_REQUIREMENTS]" ‚Üí Backend Engineer  
- /database-design "[DATA_MODEL]" ‚Üí Database Architect
Integration: API Gateway Specialist to connect all components
```

### Pattern 3: Security-First Approach
```
1. /security-audit requirements:[COMPLIANCE_NEEDS]
2. Apply security constraints to all subsequent commands
3. Route through Security Architect for all major decisions
4. Use @env-config MCP for secrets management
```

## üîß Advanced Integration Techniques

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Format
```
Task: [COMPLEX_REQUIREMENT]
Primary Agent: [LEAD_AGENT]
Supporting Agents: [AGENT_LIST]
Handoff Protocol:
  1. Lead agent creates initial design
  2. Supporting agents review and enhance
  3. Integration specialist merges outputs
MCP Coordination: @file-system for shared artifacts
```

### MCP Tool Chaining
```
Operation: [WORKFLOW_NAME]
Tool Chain:
  1. @git pull latest changes
  2. @file-system read current structure
  3. @database analyze schema
  4. Generate updates
  5. @api-test validate changes
  6. @git commit with descriptive message
```

### Conditional Routing
```
IF [CONDITION]:
  Route to [AGENT_A] with /[COMMAND_A]
  Use MCP tools: [TOOL_SET_A]
ELSE:
  Route to [AGENT_B] with /[COMMAND_B]
  Use MCP tools: [TOOL_SET_B]
```

## üìä Optimization Strategies

### 1. Context Preservation
```
Project Context File: .claude-code/context.json
Contents:
- Project overview
- Current sprint goals
- Technical decisions log
- Active feature branches
MCP: @file-system to read/update context between sessions
```

### 2. Incremental Development
```
Iteration Pattern:
1. /resume-project with context
2. Small, focused prompts to specific agents
3. Frequent @git commits
4. Regular /code-review cycles
5. Continuous /test-suite updates
```

### 3. Quality Gates
```
Before Major Changes:
- /code-review by Code Reviewer agent
- /security-audit for sensitive features
- /test-suite for regression prevention
- Performance benchmarks via @api-test
```

## üéØ Example: E-commerce Platform

### Initial Prompt
```
