## üìä Cost Tracking Templates

### Daily Cost Report
```markdown
## Daily AI Usage Report - [DATE]

### Summary
- Total Cost: $XX.XX
- vs Budget: XX%
- Efficiency Score: XX% (Haiku usage for routine tasks)

### Breakdown by Model
- Opus: $XX.XX (XX%)
- Sonnet: $XX.XX (XX%)  
- Haiku: $XX.XX (XX%)

### Top 5 Expensive Operations
1. [Operation] - $XX.XX - [Agent] - [Optimization Opportunity]
2. ...

### Recommendations
