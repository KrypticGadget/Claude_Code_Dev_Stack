# BMAD Planning Methodology Integration

## Overview

The BMAD (Business Method for AI Development) Planning Methodology has been successfully integrated into the Claude Code Dev Stack V3.0 orchestration framework. This integration provides a comprehensive two-phase planning approach with context preservation for AI-driven software development projects.

## Core Components

### 1. Agents (10 Available)
- **bmad-orchestrator.md** - Master orchestration agent
- **analyst.md** - Business and market analysis
- **architect.md** - Technical architecture design
- **bmad-master.md** - Overall methodology guidance
- **dev.md** - Development implementation
- **pm.md** - Project management
- **po.md** - Product owner responsibilities
- **qa.md** - Quality assurance and review
- **sm.md** - Scrum master/story management
- **ux-expert.md** - User experience and interface design

### 2. Agent Teams (4 Configurations)
- **team-all.yaml** - Complete team with all agents
- **team-fullstack.yaml** - Full-stack development team
- **team-ide-minimal.yaml** - Minimal IDE-focused team
- **team-no-ui.yaml** - Backend/service-focused team

### 3. Workflows (6 Patterns)
- **greenfield-fullstack.yaml** - New full-stack application development
- **greenfield-service.yaml** - New service/API development
- **greenfield-ui.yaml** - New frontend application development
- **brownfield-fullstack.yaml** - Existing full-stack application enhancement
- **brownfield-service.yaml** - Existing service enhancement
- **brownfield-ui.yaml** - Existing frontend enhancement

### 4. Templates (13 Available)
- **prd-tmpl.yaml** - Product Requirements Document
- **architecture-tmpl.yaml** - Technical architecture specification
- **front-end-spec-tmpl.yaml** - Frontend/UX specification
- **fullstack-architecture-tmpl.yaml** - Full-stack architecture
- **brainstorming-output-tmpl.yaml** - Ideation session output
- **competitor-analysis-tmpl.yaml** - Market competition analysis
- **market-research-tmpl.yaml** - Market research documentation
- **brownfield-architecture-tmpl.yaml** - Existing system architecture
- **brownfield-prd-tmpl.yaml** - Legacy system enhancement PRD
- And more specialized templates...

## Two-Phase Planning Approach

### Phase 1: Strategic Planning
1. **Project Brief** - Initial concept and scope definition
2. **Market Research** - Competitive analysis and positioning
3. **Product Requirements** - Comprehensive PRD creation
4. **UX Specification** - User experience and interface design
5. **Technical Architecture** - System design and technology stack

### Phase 2: Development Execution
1. **Document Sharding** - Breaking down large documents for IDE use
2. **Story Creation** - Detailed development stories from requirements
3. **Implementation** - Actual code development
4. **Quality Assurance** - Code review and testing
5. **Epic Management** - Managing larger feature sets

## Context Preservation Features

- **Incremental Documentation** - Documents build upon each other
- **Cross-Agent Handoffs** - Structured information transfer between agents
- **Version Control** - Change tracking in all documents
- **Template Consistency** - Standardized formats across all artifacts
- **Validation Checkpoints** - Quality gates at each phase transition

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Choose Your Workflow
Select the appropriate workflow based on your project type:
- Use `greenfield-*` workflows for new projects
- Use `brownfield-*` workflows for existing system enhancements
- Choose `fullstack`, `service`, or `ui` based on scope

### 2. Select Agent Team
Choose the team configuration that matches your needs:
- `team-fullstack` - Most comprehensive, includes all development aspects
- `team-no-ui` - For backend/API-only projects
- `team-ide-minimal` - For focused development work
- `team-all` - Complete team for complex enterprise projects

### 3. Follow Workflow Sequence
Each workflow provides:
- Clear agent sequence and handoff points
- Required inputs and outputs for each step
- Optional steps for enhanced planning
- Validation checkpoints with the Product Owner (PO) agent

### 4. Leverage Templates
Each agent uses specific templates:
- Templates ensure consistent output format
- Built-in validation and quality checks
- Structured data for downstream processing
- Version control and change tracking

## CLI Tool Integration

The `cli.js` provides automation capabilities:
- Bundle building for agent and team configurations
- Expansion pack management
- Build automation and deployment
- Tool integration support

## Configuration

The `core-config.yaml` defines:
- Document sharding settings
- File locations and patterns
- Version control integration
- Quality assurance parameters
- Development workflow preferences

## Integration with Claude Code Dev Stack V3.0

This BMAD integration enhances the V3.0 orchestration capabilities by providing:

1. **Structured Planning Process** - Systematic approach to project initiation
2. **Agent Coordination** - Clear handoff patterns between specialized agents
3. **Quality Gates** - Built-in validation at each planning phase
4. **Context Preservation** - Maintaining information continuity across agents
5. **Template Standardization** - Consistent documentation formats
6. **Workflow Automation** - Streamlined development process management

## Benefits

- **Reduced Planning Time** - Structured templates and workflows
- **Improved Quality** - Built-in validation and review processes
- **Better Documentation** - Comprehensive, linked documentation set
- **Team Coordination** - Clear roles and handoff procedures
- **Scalability** - Works for projects from MVP to enterprise scale
- **Flexibility** - Multiple workflow patterns for different project types

## Next Steps

1. **Test Integration** - Validate workflows with sample projects
2. **Customize Templates** - Adapt templates for specific use cases
3. **Train Team** - Familiarize development team with BMAD processes
4. **Monitor Usage** - Track effectiveness and identify improvements
5. **Expand Patterns** - Add custom workflows as needed

This integration provides a solid foundation for systematic, AI-driven software development planning with the Claude Code Dev Stack V3.0 platform.
