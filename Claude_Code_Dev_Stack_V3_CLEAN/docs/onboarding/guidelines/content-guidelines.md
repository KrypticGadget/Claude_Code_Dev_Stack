# Content Structure Guidelines

This document establishes the content structure and writing standards for onboarding documentation to ensure clarity, completeness, and consistency.

## üìö Content Architecture

### 1. Documentation Hierarchy

**Level 1: Project Overview** (`on_boarding.md`)
- System architecture diagram with 4-8 major components
- High-level component descriptions (2-3 sentences each)
- Clear system purpose and scope statement

**Level 2: Component Details** (Individual component files)
- Component-specific architecture diagrams
- Detailed functional descriptions
- Code references and implementation details

**Level 3: Implementation Guides** (When applicable)
- Usage examples and integration patterns
- Configuration and setup instructions
- Best practices and common pitfalls

### 2. Information Density Guidelines

**Main Overview Page**
- **Target Length**: 500-800 words
- **Component Descriptions**: 50-100 words each
- **Focus**: Understanding relationships and overall system purpose

**Component Detail Pages**
- **Target Length**: 300-600 words per component
- **Sub-component Descriptions**: 30-80 words each
- **Focus**: Specific functionality and implementation details

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Standards

### 1. Tone and Style

**Professional and Accessible**
- Use clear, concise language appropriate for technical audience
- Avoid unnecessary jargon while maintaining technical accuracy
- Write in present tense and active voice when possible

**Consistent Terminology**
- Use consistent terms throughout all documentation
- Define technical terms on first use
- Maintain terminology glossary for complex projects

### 2. Component Description Format

**Purpose Statement** (First sentence)
```
{Component Name} {primary responsibility/function} by {how it accomplishes this}.
```

**Example**: 
"The Core Framework provides foundational building blocks by defining base classes and container structures that all other components inherit from."

**Detailed Description** (Following sentences)
- Specific capabilities and features
- Key interfaces and integration points
- Role within larger system architecture

### 3. Relationship Description Standards

**Action-Oriented Language**
Use specific verbs that clearly describe the relationship:

| Relationship Type | Preferred Terms | Example |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Dependency** | "uses", "depends on", "requires" | "UI uses Core Framework" |
| **Data Flow** | "feeds into", "provides data to", "processes for" | "Data feeds into Processing" |
| **Control** | "orchestrates", "manages", "controls" | "Core orchestrates Agents" |
| **Hierarchy** | "contains", "includes", "comprises" | "System contains Components" |
| **Service** | "serves", "provides", "supplies" | "API serves Frontend" |

## üîó Code Reference Standards

### 1. Link Formatting Patterns

**Specific Method/Class References**
```markdown
<a href="https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/path/file.py#L10-L25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`module.class.method` (10:25)</a>
```

**Components**:
- **Target**: External link with security attributes
- **Format**: Backticks around qualified name + line numbers
- **Line Numbers**: `(start:end)` format for clarity

**Full File References**
```markdown
`module.path` (full file reference)
```

**Usage**: For entire modules or when specific lines aren't relevant

### 2. Code Reference Organization

**Grouping by Relevance**
```markdown
**Related Classes/Methods**:
- {Primary implementation class}
- {Key interface or base class}
- {Supporting utilities}
```

**Order by Importance**
1. Primary implementation or entry point
2. Key interfaces and base classes
3. Supporting utilities and helpers
4. Configuration and setup classes

### 3. Reference Quality Standards

**Accuracy Requirements**
- All links must be tested and functional
- Line numbers should be current and accurate
- Module paths should use correct qualified names

**Maintenance Considerations**
- Prefer stable interfaces over implementation details
- Use full file references for frequently changing code
- Include version or commit information when applicable

## üìù Section Structure Templates

### 1. Main Onboarding Page Structure

### [FAQ](standard_faq_link)
```

## üéØ Content Quality Standards

### 1. Clarity Requirements

**Comprehension Testing**
- Content should be understandable by developers familiar with the technology stack
- Key concepts should be explainable without extensive domain knowledge
- Relationships between components should be clear from descriptions alone

**Structural Clarity**
- Logical flow from general to specific information
- Clear headings and section organization
- Consistent formatting and style

### 2. Completeness Checklist

### Application Projects
**Focus**: User workflows and system integration
**Language**: Functional and service-oriented
**Details**: Emphasis on responsibilities and data flow
**Structure**: Service layers with clear boundaries
