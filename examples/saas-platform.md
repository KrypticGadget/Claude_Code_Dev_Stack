# Example: B2B SaaS Platform Development

This example demonstrates building a complete B2B SaaS platform using the Claude Code Agent System.

## Project Description
"Multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform for project management with team collaboration, task tracking, and reporting features"

## Complete Workflow

### Quick Start with Slash Commands
```bash
# Start the entire project with one command
/new-project "Multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform for project management with team collaboration, task tracking, and reporting features"
```

### Or Step-by-Step Approach

### Phase 1: Business Strategy & Analysis

**Using Agents:**
```bash
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "Multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform for project management with team collaboration, task tracking, and reporting features"
```

**Using Slash Commands:**
```bash
# Individual analysis commands
/business-analysis
/financial-model "B2B SaaS" pricing:"subscription" market:"project management"
/go-to-market "project management platform" market:"SMB teams"
/technical-feasibility "multi-tenant SaaS" scale:"1000 organizations"
```

The orchestrator will coordinate:
- **Business Analyst**: Market size, competitor analysis, pricing models
- **Financial Analyst**: Revenue projections, cost analysis, break-even calculations
- **CEO Strategy**: Positioning, differentiation, go-to-market strategy
- **Technical CTO**: Technical feasibility, scalability assessment

**Decision Point**: Business case approval
- Projected ARR: $2.5M by Year 2
- Initial investment: $350K
- Tech stack recommendation: React + Node.js + PostgreSQL

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture

```bash
> Master orchestrator: Continue to technical planning phase
```

Agents activated:
- **Technical Specifications**: Detailed requirements documentation
- **Database Architecture**: Multi-tenant schema design
- **API Integration Specialist**: Third-party integrations (Slack, Jira, Google)
- **Frontend Architecture**: Application structure, routing, state management

**Key Deliverables**:
1. Complete API specification (OpenAPI)
2. Database schema with tenant isolation
3. Frontend component hierarchy
4. Integration architecture

### Phase 3: Development Setup

```bash
> Master orchestrator: Prepare development environment
```

- **DevOps Engineering**: CI/CD pipeline, Docker configuration
- **Script Automation**: Setup scripts, development tools
- **Integration Setup**: Development environment configuration

**Generated Assets**:
- `docker-compose.yml` for local development
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Environment setup scripts
- Development documentation

### Phase 4: Frontend Development

**Using Agents:**
```bash
> Use the frontend-mockup agent to create UI prototypes for dashboard and task management
```

**Using Slash Commands:**
```bash
# Quick mockup creation
/frontend-mockup "dashboard with analytics widgets and task board"
/site-architecture
/production-frontend "React" features:"dashboard, tasks, team collaboration"
```

- **Frontend Mockup**: HTML/CSS prototypes
- **UI/UX Design**: Design system, accessibility
- **Production Frontend**: React component implementation

**Components Created**:
- Dashboard with analytics widgets
- Task board with drag-and-drop
- Team collaboration interface
- Reporting dashboard

### Phase 5: Backend Development

**Using Agents:**
```bash
> Use the backend-services agent to implement core API services
```

**Using Slash Commands:**
```bash
# Backend implementation
/backend-service "REST API" requirements:"multi-tenant, JWT auth, webhooks"
/database-design "multi-tenant SaaS with tenant isolation"
/middleware-setup "Redis" usecase:"caching and rate limiting"
```

- **Backend Services**: RESTful API implementation
- **Database Architecture**: Query optimization, indexing
- **Middleware Specialist**: Caching, rate limiting, authentication

**Services Implemented**:
- Authentication & authorization (JWT + RBAC)
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Task management CRUD operations
- Real-time notifications (WebSocket)
- Reporting engine

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing

```bash
> Master orchestrator: Execute integration and testing phase
```

- **API Integration Specialist**: Slack, Google Calendar, Jira integrations
- **Testing Automation**: Test suite implementation
- **Quality Assurance**: Code review, best practices
- **Security Architecture**: Security audit, penetration testing

### Phase 7: Production Deployment

```bash
> Master orchestrator: Prepare for production deployment
```

- **DevOps Engineering**: AWS infrastructure, Kubernetes setup
- **Performance Optimization**: Load testing, optimization
- **Technical Documentation**: Complete documentation package

**Final Deliverables**:
- Production-ready application
- Complete test coverage (>80%)
- API documentation
- Deployment guides
- Monitoring setup

3. **Quality Gates**: Regular decision points prevented scope creep
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs reduced onboarding time for new developers

## Commands Used

```bash
# Initial project
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "Multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform..."

# Specific tasks
> Use the database-architecture agent to design multi-tenant schema with row-level security
> Use the api-integration-specialist agent to implement Slack webhook integration
> Use the frontend-mockup agent to create task board UI prototype
> Use the security-architecture agent to perform security audit
> Use the devops-engineering agent to setup Kubernetes deployment

# Status checks
> Master orchestrator: Status report for current phase
> Master orchestrator: Prepare for next human decision point
```
