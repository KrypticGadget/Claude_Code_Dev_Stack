## Data Modeling & Schema Design

### Entity Relationship Design
```sql
-- Core entity relationships example
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    status order_status_enum NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    currency CHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    product_id UUID NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0),
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    total_price DECIMAL(10,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (quantity * unit_price) STORED
);
```

### Normalization Strategies
```yaml
normal_forms:
  1nf: "Eliminate repeating groups, atomic values only"
  2nf: "Remove partial dependencies on composite keys"
  3nf: "Remove transitive dependencies"
  bcnf: "Every determinant is a candidate key"
  
denormalization_patterns:
  read_optimization: "Duplicate data for query performance"
  aggregation_tables: "Pre-computed summary data"
  caching_tables: "Frequently accessed computed values"
  reporting_schemas: "Separate read-optimized structures"
```

### Data Types & Constraints
```sql
-- Optimized data type selections
CREATE TABLE products (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    sku VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (price >= 0),
    category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(id),
    tags TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    search_vector TSVECTOR GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
        to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || COALESCE(description, ''))
    ) STORED,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category ON products(category_id) WHERE is_active;
CREATE INDEX idx_products_search ON products USING GIN(search_vector);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_metadata ON products USING GIN(metadata);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_tags ON products USING GIN(tags);
```

## Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization Strategies
```sql
-- Index optimization examples
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_user_status 
ON orders(user_id, status) 
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing');

-- Partial index for active records
CREATE INDEX idx_users_active_email 
ON users(email) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Composite index for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_lookup 
ON order_items(order_id, product_id) 
INCLUDE (quantity, unit_price);

-- Expression index for case-insensitive searches
CREATE INDEX idx_users_lower_email 
ON users(LOWER(email));
```

### Query Pattern Optimization
```sql
-- Efficient pagination with cursor-based approach
SELECT id, name, created_at 
FROM products 
WHERE created_at > $1 
ORDER BY created_at 
LIMIT 20;

-- Optimized aggregation with proper grouping
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as day,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(total_amount) as daily_revenue
FROM orders 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)
ORDER BY day DESC;

-- Window functions for efficient ranking
SELECT 
    product_id,
    category_id,
    price,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category_id ORDER BY price DESC) as price_rank
FROM products 
WHERE is_active = true;
```

### Connection and Resource Management
```yaml
connection_pooling:
  pgbouncer:
    pool_mode: "transaction"
    default_pool_size: 20
    max_client_conn: 1000
    
  application_pools:
    read_pool: "10-15 connections for read operations"
    write_pool: "5-10 connections for write operations"
    
resource_limits:
  shared_buffers: "25% of available RAM"
  work_mem: "4MB per connection"
  maintenance_work_mem: "256MB for maintenance operations"
  
monitoring:
  slow_queries: "Log queries taking >1 second"
  connection_monitoring: "Track connection usage and wait times"
  index_usage: "Monitor index hit ratios and unused indexes"
```

## Scaling Strategies

    read_queries: "Route to replica servers"
    write_queries: "Route to master server"
    failover: "Automatic promotion of replicas"

partitioning_strategies:
  range_partitioning:
    pattern: "Partition by date ranges (monthly/yearly)"
    use_case: "Time-series data, historical analysis"
    
  hash_partitioning:
    pattern: "Distribute data evenly across partitions"
    use_case: "Even load distribution, user data"
    
  list_partitioning:
    pattern: "Partition by discrete values (region, category)"
    use_case: "Geographic distribution, categorical data"
```

### Sharding Implementation
```yaml
sharding_strategies:
  horizontal_sharding:
    key_based: "Shard by user_id, tenant_id, or geographic region"
    directory_based: "Lookup service to map keys to shards"
    
  vertical_sharding:
    feature_based: "Separate databases for different features"
    service_oriented: "Database per microservice pattern"
    
shard_management:
  shard_key_selection: "Choose keys with even distribution"
  cross_shard_queries: "Minimize queries spanning multiple shards"
  rebalancing: "Plan for adding/removing shards"
```

## Data Migration & Schema Evolution

### Migration Planning
```sql
-- Safe migration patterns
BEGIN;

-- Add new column with default value
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Create index concurrently (no table lock)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_preferences 
ON users USING GIN(preferences);

-- Update data in batches to avoid long locks
UPDATE users 
SET preferences = '{"theme": "light", "notifications": true}'
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id FROM users 
    WHERE preferences = '{}' 
    LIMIT 1000
);

COMMIT;
```

### Zero-Downtime Migrations
```yaml
migration_strategy:
  additive_changes:
    - add_columns: "New columns with default values"
    - add_indexes: "Create indexes concurrently"
    - add_tables: "New tables don't affect existing queries"
    
  backward_compatible:
    - dual_writes: "Write to both old and new schemas"
    - gradual_migration: "Migrate data in background batches"
    - feature_flags: "Control which schema version to use"
    
  cleanup_phase:
    - remove_old_columns: "Drop unused columns after migration"
    - drop_old_indexes: "Remove redundant indexes"
    - consolidate_tables: "Merge temporary migration tables"
```

## Backup & Recovery Strategies
