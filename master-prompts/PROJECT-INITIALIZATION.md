# Master Prompts - Project Initialization

These universal prompts help you start any type of project using the Claude Code Agent System. Replace all variables in square brackets with your specific values.

## Full Project Initialization

```
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "[PROJECT_TYPE] for [TARGET_AUDIENCE] that [CORE_FUNCTIONALITY]. Key requirements: [REQUIREMENT_1], [REQUIREMENT_2], [REQUIREMENT_3]. Technology preferences: [TECH_STACK]. Budget: [BUDGET_RANGE]. Timeline: [TIMELINE]. Success metrics: [METRIC_1], [METRIC_2]"
```

## Business Analysis

```
> Use the business-analyst agent to analyze market opportunity for [PRODUCT/SERVICE] targeting [MARKET_SEGMENT] with [VALUE_PROPOSITION]. Include TAM analysis, competitive landscape, pricing models, and [SPECIFIC_ANALYSIS_FOCUS]
```

## Technical Feasibility

```
> Use the technical-cto agent to assess feasibility of [PROJECT_CONCEPT] supporting [USER_COUNT] users with [PERFORMANCE_REQUIREMENT]. Evaluate [TECHNOLOGY_OPTIONS] for [SPECIFIC_CONSTRAINTS]
```

## Project Planning

```
> Use the project-manager agent to create project plan for [PROJECT_NAME] with [TEAM_SIZE] developers, [BUDGET] budget, and [DEADLINE] deadline. Include [METHODOLOGY] methodology and [DELIVERABLE_FREQUENCY] deliverables
```

## Financial Projections

```
> Use the financial-analyst agent to create financial model for [BUSINESS_MODEL] with [PRICING_STRUCTURE] serving [CUSTOMER_SEGMENT]. Project [TIME_HORIZON] with [GROWTH_ASSUMPTIONS]
```

## Strategic Positioning

```
> Use the ceo-strategy agent to develop go-to-market strategy for [PRODUCT/SERVICE] differentiating through [UNIQUE_VALUE]. Target market: [MARKET]. Competition: [COMPETITORS]. Distribution: [CHANNELS]
```

## Requirements Gathering

```
> Use the technical-specifications agent to document requirements for [SYSTEM_NAME] supporting [USE_CASES]. Include [FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS], [NON_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS], and [INTEGRATION_REQUIREMENTS]
```

## Architecture Design

```
> Use the technical-specifications agent to design architecture for [APPLICATION_TYPE] handling [SCALE_REQUIREMENTS] with [PERFORMANCE_TARGETS]. Consider [CONSTRAINTS] and integrate with [EXISTING_SYSTEMS]
```

## Quick Start Templates

### Minimal Project Start
```
> Use the master-orchestrator agent to begin new project: "[PROJECT_TYPE] that [CORE_FUNCTION]"
```

### Business-First Approach
```
> Use the business-analyst agent to validate [BUSINESS_IDEA] for [TARGET_MARKET]
```

### Technical-First Approach
```
> Use the technical-cto agent to design [TECHNICAL_SOLUTION] for [PROBLEM_STATEMENT]
```
